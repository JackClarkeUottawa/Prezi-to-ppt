# Prezi-to-ppt
This is the last prototype from my prezi to ppt project.

It was an app designed to improve the accessibility of Prezi by converting a prezi presentation to a screen readable pdf. 

This app was made before I knew anything about software engineering or design, as a result it doesn't work anymore. 

To run the app simply run the PreztoUI file and input a url of the format provided.
